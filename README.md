Please feel free to test out the application by adding your favorite golf courses to the database or entering some data about your latest round.

## Description

This is a personal project I started to practice my web development skills and learn a new framework. This application is built using the Django Python Web framework.
The application allows users to add golf courses to the database. Golf courses can have any number of holes and each hole can have multiple tees with varying distances.
When a user logs in and creates an account the user can the create a new round to track their score.
